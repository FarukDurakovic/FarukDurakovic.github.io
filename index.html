            <h3 class="text-position header-border">The Playable Characters</h3>
            <p class="text-position-2 p-border">In Smite, there are currently 93 playable gods, goddesses, and mythical beings. New characters are constantly added in a 4 to 6 week recurring period and patches are deployed to the game every 2 weeks to buff or nerf a god(dess), item, or gameplay feature. A buff is a positive change that increases the power or usability of the changed character or feature. A nerf is a negative change the lowers overall performance, usually meant to lower strength of characters that are overperforming over others.
